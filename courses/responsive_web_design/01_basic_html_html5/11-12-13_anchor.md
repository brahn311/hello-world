# Link to External Pages with Anchor ElementsPassed
You can use `a` (anchor) elements to link to content outside of your web page.

a elements need a destination web address called an href attribute. They also need anchor text.

Here's an example:
```
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org">this links to freecodecamp.org</a>
```

Then your browser will display the text this links to `freecodecamp.org` as a link you can click. And that link will take you to the web address [https://www.freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org.)

### Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements
`a` (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.

To create an internal link, you assign a link's _href attribute_ to a hash symbol `#` plus the value of the _id attribute_ for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.

Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:
```
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
```

When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts header element.

### Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph
You can nest links within other text elements.
```
<p>
  Here's a <a target="_blank" href="http://freecodecamp.org"> link to freecodecamp.org</a> for you to follow.
</p>
```
Let's break down the example. Normal text is wrapped in the p element:
```
<p> Here's a ... for you to follow. </p>
```
Next is the anchor element <a> (which requires a closing tag </a>):
```
<a> ... </a>
```
`target` is an _anchor tag attribute_ that specifies where to open the link. The value `_blank` specifies to open the link in a new tab. The `href` is an _anchor tag attribute_ that contains the **URL address** of the link:
```
<a href="http://freecodecamp.org"> ... </a>
```
The text, link to freecodecamp.org, within the a element is called anchor text, and will display the link to click:
```
<a href=" ... ">link to freecodecamp.org</a>
```
The final output of the example will look like this:

Here's a [link to freecodecamp.org](http://freecodecamp.org) for you to follow.
