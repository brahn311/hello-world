### How to order adjectives in English
In many languages, adjectives denoting attributes usually occur in a specific order.Generally, the adjective order in English is:
- Quantity or number
- Quality or opinion
- Size
- Age
- Shape
- Color
- Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)
- Purpose or qualifier

For example:
- I love that really big old green antique car that always parked at the end of the street.
- My sister adopted a beautiful big white bulldog.

When there are two or more adjectives that are from the same group, the word and is placed between the two adjectives:
- The house is green and red.
- The library has old and new books.

When there are three or more adjectives from the same adjective group, place a comma between each of the coordinate adjectives:
- We live in the big green, white and red house at the end of the street.
- My friend lost a red, black and white watch.

A comma is not placed between an adjective and the noun.
