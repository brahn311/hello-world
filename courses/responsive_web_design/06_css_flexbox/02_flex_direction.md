# Use the flex-direction Property to Make a Row

Adding `display: flex;` to an element turns it into a flex container. This makes it possible to align any children of that element into rows or columns. You do this by adding the flex-direction property to the parent item and setting it to row or column. Creating a row will align the children horizontally, and creating a column will align the children vertically.

This property can also create a `column` by vertically stacking the children of a flex container.

Other options for `flex-direction` are `row-reverse` and `column-reverse`.

> **Note!** The default value for the `flex-direction` property is `row`.
