# Simple past sentences

#### Simple past with the verb be and other verbs
We use the simple past with the verb be to talk about how things were before.

- _I_ **was** young when we moved.
- _She_ **was** a very good student at school.
- _He_ **wasn´t** very quiet when he was a kid.
- **Was** _it_ too difficult?
- _You_ **were** very good students at school.

#### With verb be:
- **If we have an affirmative sentence**  
We have a subject, then we have the verb be conjugated in past and then we have the complement
   - (+) Subject + verb be + complement
- **If it is a negative sentence**  
We have the subject, then we have the verb be in past, then we have not and after that we have the complement
   - (-) Subject + verb be + not + complement
- **If it is a question**  
Remember that you can always use a WH question before the verb be, then we have the verb be, after that we have the subject and the complement and finally the question mark
   - (?) Verb be + subject + complement + ?

#### For other regular verbs:
The simple past is formed by adding `ed` at the end of the verb
   - We moved to Canada when I was 5

   #### What was your childhood like?

   My childhood was very nice. I was born in Bogota in 1988, I was named after a famous singer that my mom loved. My dad was 22 and my mom was 21 when I was born, they were very young but they loved each other very much. My dad was a college student, he studied engineering at a public university in Bogota. My mom worked for a small company in a commercial area of the city.

   When I was 5 I went to primary school. My school was very small, it was located near my house, it was the same school my mom went to. I was very outgoing and talkative when I was at school, I had many friends. I was a good student, but I sometimes got into trouble because I was always talking to my friends.

   When I was not at school I was out with my friends. I had many friends in my neighborhood, we played and had lots of fun. I was a little chubby because candies were my favorite food. I was very active and very funny.
