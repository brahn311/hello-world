# Improve Accessibility of Audio Content with the audio Element

HTML5's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.

Here's an example:
```
<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>
```

> **Note!** Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.
