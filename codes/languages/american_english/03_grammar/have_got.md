In English, any time you hace the verb "get" in a lesson,
you know you're in for a bit of a ride
because there are so many different ways to use "get" in English.

#### Have Got
We're looking at "get" when combined with the verb "have"

1. Emphatic for of `have to` _(obligation)_  
`I've got to see that movie!` = _I have to see that movie_ (more emphatic)  
`Subject` + `have got to` + `base verb`  
> **Note!** There are no past or future form for this. Use: `had to` or `will have to`  
There are no negative form. Use: `You don't have to`...  
Except in "slang" (cool way) `You don't gotta do that!` (gotta = have to)
2. Another form for the possessive `have`  
`She's got a big family` = _She has a big family_ = She's (has) got a big family
3. Present, past, and future perfect grammar forms _(to get / receive)_  
`have got` `had got` `will have got`  
`Have gotten` `had gotten` `will have gotten`  
`I had got a bad grade` = _I had received a bad grade_ = I had gotten a bad grade
> **Note!** In the American English form, "got" is not really correctly formed  
(the past participle is actually "gotten" / Brithish form)
