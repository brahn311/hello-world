# The verb be
To be is a copula: a word used to link the _subject of a sentence_ with a _predicate_ (a subject complement)

The copular verb **be** is manifested in eight forms: `be`, `is`, `am`, `are`, `was`, `were`, `been`, and `being` in English.

These verbs precede _nouns_ or _adjectives_ in a sentence, which become predicate nouns and predicate adjectives similar to those that function with a linking verb.

- **Copula**: in linguistics, is a word or phrase that links the subject of a sentence to a subject complement, such as the word is in the sentence _"The sky **is** blue"_ or the phrase was not being in the sentence _"It was not **being** used."
- **Nouns**: a word (other than a pronoun) used to identify any of a class of people, places, or things (common noun), or to name a particular one of these (proper noun).
- **Adjectives**: a word naming an attribute of a noun, such as sweet, red, or technical.
