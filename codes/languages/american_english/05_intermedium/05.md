##### Dialogue
**Two people talking about belongings**
  - **Paula**: I need a bigger bookshelf, the one that I have is so small.
  - **Camila**: Really? How many books do you have?
  - **Paula**: I have tons of books but I also discs and ornaments.
  - **Camila**: Well… Mine are just a few, maybe you should sell them.
  - **Paula**: There is no way I’m selling them. I love mine, I just need a bigger place to put them.
  - **Camila**: I think you have too many things. Your closet is about to explode.
  - **Paula**: I know. My mom is just the same thing, she has so many clothes but hers are so beautiful.
  - **Camila**: Well, maybe she doesn’t need so many.
