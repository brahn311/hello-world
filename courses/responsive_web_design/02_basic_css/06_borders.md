# Properties for borders

### Add Borders Around Your Elements
CSS borders have properties like style, color and width.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:
```
.thin-red-border {
  border-color: red;
  border-width: 5px;
  border-style: solid;
}
```

### Add Rounded Corners with border-radius
Your cat photo currently has sharp corners. We can round out those corners with a CSS property called `border-radius`.

You can specify a border-radius with pixels.

Also, this property can be used directly for an `img`.

And you can to create circular images using percentage.
