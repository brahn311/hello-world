# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
While _HTML_ and _CSS_ control the content and styling of a page, **JavaScript** is used to make it interactive. In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.

Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.

Along the way, you'll also learn two important programing styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programing (OOP), and Functional Programing (FP).
