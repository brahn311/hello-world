	- My first job was in a call center as a customer service representative for a telephone company; I only spoke Spanish and worked with them for 2 years, which was when my fixed term contracts ended.
	- Then I worked in 2 bookstores, I like to read a lot and I liked to work and be surrounded by books. First I was customer service personnel for 3 years then I looked for opportunities in a bookstore where I worked with the owners and in 4 years I became a store manager; I attended suppliers, I was in charge of payments and payroll.
	- Later I started working in the IT area for CANTV, a telecommunications company in Venezuela, I worked in the software development area, in the test environment department, where I developed for that department a system of registration and tracking of events. I learned how the software development area was structured, I also learned the process of capturing information from a customer who needs some software solution to improve some of their internal processes, where those customers are employees of other areas of the company.

1. **Nombra 5 virtudes**
	- I am honest

1. **Cuales son mis debilidades**
	- Confidence:  
	When I do something I like to do it right, but when I do not feel that I do it well, sometimes I get a little scared and in critical situations I even lose confidence, so in those moments I take the time to prepare myself and I do not give up, because I like challenges and I strive to achieve my goals
	- Perfectionist:  
	When I was working in the bakery, I was learning how to decorate with fondant and when I had to make a piece of scenery or a doll and it didn't look good, if there was enough time to repeat the piece, I did it. I did it thinking that customers like to pay to have a good looking product. That never caused any inconvenience at work, but sometimes people told me that I looked like a perfectionist, because I like to take care of every little detail.
1. **Name 5 faults**
	- Sometimes I'm a bit distracted, that's why I focus on always paying attention to all the details.
1. **Why would i like to work here.**
	- I learned English in school, but then I gave it up to practice for a long time, but recently I have started studying again and I want to keep improving my English level and become more confident in speaking this language.
	- And I think I could give a lot of myself to this company and continue to learn together.
1. **Why they should hire me?**
	- I like to think that everything we do leaves a learning experience, and it is important to always put that knowledge into practice and gain more experience.
	- Leaving aside programming languages and the fact that I love working with computers, I can say that:
	- I learned how to do questionnaires,
	- how to do an interview,
	- how to talk to a client and
	- how to be empathetic and assertive.
	- I know how to work in a team,
	- I know how to make documentation manuals, take minutes in meetings.
	- I have been a project manager,
	- But as a joke, I must say that I am not a hacker, just to be clear of course.

1. **How does this job relate to you and your studies?**
	- Since I can remember I like to create, to build things,
	- When I was a child I loved to draw fountains and waterfalls, I used the colors as I watched the lights of the fountains.
	- Then I played with wooden sticks and made towers like buildings and I loved to watch them fall, like in jenga.
	- Then I learned a few things about food and realized that I liked to cook.
	- I studied technical medium in traumatology and orthopedics and i liked to help people and care of them and how to listen to people in difficult times. Turing that period I wanted to study medicine but I didn't, because when I learned about computers, I decided to change my mind.
	- Now I know why I like to create things, to cook,
	- I have realized that I always thought like a programmer.
	- Everything is related to input, output and process.
	- When I learned programming, I understood that almost all the time it was about solving problems, you have some data and you need to get some important information from this data, so it's all about how to make decisions and do it and check if that was correct, and it's just like in real life.
	- For example when I hungry and I have some ingredients and cooking utensils, we can create a dish but I should be careful with the process to get the results I want to have.
	- I like to follow the rules, I know how important it is to do a process correctly, because that could alter the results.
