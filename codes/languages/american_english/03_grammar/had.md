# HAD (past perfect)
English Tips

The past perfect is used when two events happened in the past,
with one past action having occurred even before the other past action.
To form the past perfect, use `had` and the `past participle of a verb` in one part of the sentence.
Often, the regular past tense is used in the other part of the sentence.
- I `had` a beautiful dog when I was little
