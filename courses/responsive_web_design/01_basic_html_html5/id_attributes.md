### Set the id of an Element
In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.

There are several benefits to using id attributes you can use an id to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with *_JavaScript_*.

`id` attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same id attribute.

Here's an example of how you give your element the id:
```
<h2 id="cat-photo-app">
```
