### Make Links Navigable with HTML Access Keys

HTML offers the accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element. Adding an accesskey attribute can make navigation more efficient for keyboard-only users.

HTML5 allows this attribute to be used on any element, but it's particularly useful when it's used with interactive ones. This includes links, buttons, and form controls.

Here's an example:
```
<button accesskey="b">Important Button</button>
```
