# Difference between simple present and present continuous
We use the simple present to talk about routines or things that happen all the time

#### Simple present
- I have tea and crackers for breakfast
- She walks everywhere, she doesn't have a car
- He wakes up early in the morning
- We eat a lot of fruits and vegetables
- What do you do to stay healthy?

#### Present continuous
We use the present continuous to talk about things that are happening right now

- `Subject` + `verb be` + `verb+ing` + `complement` _(Positive)_
- `Subject` + `verb be` + `not` + `verb+ing` + `complement` _(Negative)_
- `Verb be` + `subject` + `verb+ing` + `complement` + `?` _(Question)_

##### Examples
- I'm swimming three times a week
- I'm trying to cut down on sugar and coffee
- She is waking up early to go to the gym
- He isn't eating sugar right now
- They aren't reading any books right now
- What are you doing to stay healthy?
- A: What are you doing these days? _(estos dias)_
- B: I'm jogging at the park _(jog = empujon / jogging = trot = trotar)_
