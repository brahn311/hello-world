# Determiners
We use determiners to express the reference of a noun in a given context
They tell us if the noun is general or specific.

#### How to use determiners
There are two categories of determinants
- Specific determiners
- General determiners

#### Specific determiners
We use specific determiners when we believe the listener or reader knows exactly what we are talking about.  
- **Article**: `The`
- **Possessives**: `My` `your` `his` `her` `its` `their` `our`
- **Demonstratives**: `This` `that` `these` `those`
- **Interrogative**: `Which`

##### Examples
- Do you want _the_ ketchup?
- Look at _those_ lovely dogs
- Thanks for _your_ present
- This is _my_ computer
- People don’t like _this_ candidate

#### General determiners
We use general determiners when the listener or reader doesn't know what we are talking about.  
We can use an _uncountable noun_ or a _plural noun_ with no.
`A` `an` `any` `another` `other` `what`

##### Examples
- I like _any_ dog I see.
- I need _another_ computer.
- _Education_ is the most relevant aspect for a society.
- _Water_ is good for you.

##### Reading
**Popular and unpopular subjects at school**

Generally, there are always some subjects that people like and some that they fear. In my particular case, my partners at school were afraid of math and physics, they didn’t enjoy those subjects because they didn’t understand them. I think that most of their fears were based on the fact that teachers, parents and other people told us that those subjects were very difficult and only very smart people could understand those topics.

For girls, it was even harder since because teachers used to tell us that girls were not so good at math. For many years, I believed that that was true, so I never made an effort to succeed at it. I guess I thought my strengths were more in the languages, literature and arts areas. For that, I made huge efforts to be good at those ones.

My best friend wanted to become a caster and for that, she was very into learning chemestry. I think she was the only one who liked that subject because she was very aware of the reasons why she needed it. I now realize that if I had known how useful that knowledge was going to be, I would have learned more mathematics, logic and number processing.

Nowadays, I am trying to learn more from these subjects, even though I am a professional today, I still feel that I need to learn from every subject.
